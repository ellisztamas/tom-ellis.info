I am a biolgist with a interest in evoutionary genetics, data analysis in R and Python, and eating well.
A particular interest is in the genetics of quantitative traits.

My analytical focus is on writing robust, reproducible code, and on designing experiments that make sure you don’t run into trouble in the first place.
I mostly work on plants because they don’t bite or run away, you can do what you like to them, and because they’re delicious.
